## Notebooks

### APRIORI Algorithm
**Notebook**: `APRIORI Algorithm.ipynb`  
The APRIORI algorithm, which is widely used in market basket analysis. It helps in identifying frequent item sets and generating association rules from transactional datasets.

### Ada Boost Algorithm
**Notebook**: `Ada Boost Algorithm.ipynb`  
AdaBoost algorithm is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. The focus is on boosting techniques and their application to classification problems.

### C4.5 Algorithm
**Notebook**: `C 4.5 Algorithm.ipynb`  
The C4.5 algorithm is an extension of the ID3 algorithm used for generating a decision tree. 

### Classification and Regression Tree Algorithm (CART)
**Notebook**: `Classification and Regression Tree Algorithm.ipynb`  
The CART algorithm is a fundamental machine learning technique used for classification and regression tasks. 

### Equivalence Class Transformation Algorithm
**Notebook**: `Equivalence Class Transformation Algorithm.ipynb`  
The Equivalence Class Transformation (ECLAT) algorithm is an efficient approach to mining frequent item sets. It contrasts with the APRIORI algorithm by focusing on the vertical data format.

### ID3 Algorithm
**Notebook**: `ID3.ipynb`  
The ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm is a foundational algorithm for decision tree learning. This notebook walks through the process of building a decision tree using the ID3 algorithm, with a focus on information gain as the splitting criterion.
